AKS 
workstation connect to aks
create ACR
pull code
create image 
push to ACR
attach ACR to AKS
create postgres deployment
create prestiance volume
create backend deployment using ACR image
host frontend on webapp



create postgres use 
AKS use config map and secret
host frontend on webapp

================================================================
create postgres use container instance instance of AKS
use environment variables for AKS
host frontend on webapp
================================= 
done---- not functionating as expected request goes to backend but backend api to db fetch did not work 
this was due to an issue
--Mixed content: load all resources via HTTPS to improve the security of your site
Even though the initial HTML page is loaded over a secure HTTPS connection, some resources like images, stylesheets or scripts are being accessed over an insecure HTTP connection. Usage of insecure resources is restricted to strengthen the security of your entire site.

Reason of the issue-
this issue triggers if we are deploying site backend by using container instance that is on http not on https
but the site running on static webapp comes from https. so, frontend header reading data from non secure http creates an issue.

Resolutio-
static always runs on https we can't change it to http, here we must look for a solution where container instance will be on https.

how i resolved
deployed the frontend on webapp by creating frontend image
on web app configuration setting modified
FTP state - all allowed
HTTPS Only - off

then browse frontend site and on browser in place of https:// keep http://
it will open as not secure and the site will be accessable
=================================================================================

use postgres on vm for low cost 
AKS use key vault
host frontend on webapp
